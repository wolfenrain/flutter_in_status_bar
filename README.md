Example of a Flutter app in the status bar.

---

This is the default counter app from Flutter but instead of running in a `NSWindow` it runs inside a `NSPopover` that is connected to a button in the status bar.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

You can run this application as you would with any other Flutter application. But if you run it in debug mode it will only attach after you press the button that appears in the status bar, as that will start up the Flutter Engine.
